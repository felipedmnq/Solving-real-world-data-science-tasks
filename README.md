# Solving real world data science tasks
Solving real world data science tasks whit Python Pandas.

I found Keith's videos by chance and I really liked the way they are made, encouraging the viewer to answer the tasks before watching Keith's answer. It is an excellent way to train skills with Pandas and Python and a great way to learn and get experience.

The way Keith Galli prepared his video tutorial encourages the viewer to look for his own solutions before watching the “tutorial”, having the opportunity to compare two solutions (or the same solution) and decide which one is more efficient or better. I really liked Keith's video and I intend to follow his YouTube channel and watch more tutorials like this. This experience was very productive for me, I could see that I am evolving as a student of data analysis, which makes me more confident to continue my studies. I was able to do all tasks proposed by Keith and solve 4 of 5 questions by myself and it was really nice.

I'd like to thank Keith Galli, from Keith's Galli youtube channel. This particular project helped me a lot and I'm greatful for that
